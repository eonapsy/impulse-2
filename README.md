## Welcome to impulse: Reborn
impulse is a Garry's Mod Framework that can be tailored to nearly anything. With performance, aesthetic, and accessibility at the core of the design,
the sky is the limit for what you can do.

### Reborn
impulse: Reborn is a new maintained version of impulse, aiming to upgrade impulse for a better, more modern experience.
New features such as customizable fonts are being implemented, as well as a built-in logs system which will start soon.

## Security
Security is the backbone of impulse. Networking and client data handling has been carefully crafted to keep troublemakers at bay.
----  
If you operate a large server using the impulse framework, or want to switch to it, please send an email to `nick@landis-community.com` for
access to the impulse Anti-Cheat 2.0, which features cross database references across any server with the anti-cheat.

## Performance
impulse has been optimized to the bit for maximum performance. Servers can expect to achieve 128 players concurrently (given proper moderation and
a well constructed schema) without major issues.
